        <p>In addition, I got the opportunity to work in my final project with tools like react native and Python and in addition to that I used Raspberry Pi and other sensors.</p>

                <h3>CAREFREE PARKING </h3>
                <p>The carefree parking system is designed to provide a solution to the parking distress in a parking lot. Its application enables the user to reserve a free parking space in an open-air parking lot and navigate to it. The implications of the project are that it enriches and improves the parking experience. 
                    that consists of a physical mechanism to prevent from others to occupy it, a camera for license plate recognition to verify the reservation , a distance sensor to detect occupancy status in real time and a navigation inside the parking lot feature.</p>
